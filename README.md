# COVID-19 Insights Dashboard (SQL + Tableau)

## 📊 Project Overview
This project presents a global analytical dashboard built using **Tableau**, designed to visualize the spread and impact of COVID-19 across countries and continents.  
The data was initially explored and processed using **SQL** to clean, aggregate, and extract key indicators before visualization.

---

## 🧠 Objectives
- Analyze and visualize global COVID-19 statistics such as total cases, total deaths, and mortality percentage.
- Compare the **percentage of population infected** across selected countries (India, China, United States).
- Visualize **cumulative deaths per continent** to highlight regional disparities.
- Track the progression of infection percentages over time.

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- **SQL** – for data cleaning, filtering, and aggregation from raw datasets.  
- **Tableau** – for building interactive dashboards, charts, and maps.  
- **Data Source** – Publicly available COVID-19 datasets (e.g., WHO or Our World in Data).

## 📈 Dashboard Features
- **Global Numbers Panel:** Displays total cases, total deaths, and death percentage.  
- **Continent-wise Bar Chart:** Visualizes cumulative deaths per continent.  
- **Geographical Heatmap:** Shows percent of population infected per country.  
- **Trend Line Visualization:** Depicts infection growth trends for major countries over time.

---

## 🔍 Insights
- The **United States** and **Europe** reported the highest infection and death counts.  
- Developing regions such as **Africa** and **Oceania** showed relatively lower infection percentages.  
- Visual trends highlight distinct infection trajectories among selected countries.
